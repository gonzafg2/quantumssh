# Changelog

All notable changes to QuantumSSH will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial project scaffolding, governance documents, contribution
  guidelines, license, and CI/CD configuration.
- Project security PGP key published at `keys/security.asc`
  (Ed25519 + Curve25519, fingerprint
  `66DB5100B0700E4AE051971F9A8DFF06AFD25B24`, expires 2028-05-09).
  The `<TBD>` placeholder in `SECURITY.md` is replaced with the
  fingerprint metadata and verified-import instructions.

### Changed

- Email aliases for `quantumssh.org` are live: `security@quantumssh.org`
  and `conduct@quantumssh.org` accept and forward correctly. The
  apex and `www.quantumssh.org` redirect (HTTP 301) to the GitHub
  repository, preserving the request path. The "DNS not yet provisioned"
  caveat in `SECURITY.md` has been removed.
